# Moon-Mission-LVM3
1. In this moon mission project, I have created a stacked column bar chart with multi-color bars.
2. To display when moon missions are launched by countries, I have used a line chart.
3. To showcase the number of launches over the years, I have used an area chart.
4. For the distribution of mission outcomes, I have depicted it using a pie chart.
5. I have created a map to display these missions country-wise on the map.
